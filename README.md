TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment
===========================

This physics experiment can be preformed by people of many skill levels. Once the apparatus has been built, these user-friendly programs will be able to assist in the collection of data and a description of the results.

The experiment is broken up into three stages:
1. Recording the object falling
2. Obtaining data coordinates from the recorded video
3. Plotting and fitting the data

Any stage of this experiment could be replaced with user code along the way, but this gives a simplistic benchmark for younger or less experienced students.

Each folder has a separate README file explaining the different parts of each program and how to properly operate them. There are some scripts that are shortcuts to type in terminal.
