##Tiny Titan Recording Apparatus Instructions
This apparatus is built with a mixture of 80/20 and some material from the hardware store. The design was developed as simplistically as possible keeping in mind that not everyone has power tools or a high levels of building skills. Below will give very detailed instructions on how to develop both frames and assemble the claw.

#### Frame Assembly  

#####Required Tools
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/toolsUsed.jpg "Tools Used")   
*Ferrule Crimping Tool Recommended*

1. Take all three 2' pieces, two of the 3' pieces, and eight of the corner brackets and align them like in the picture below.   
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/start.jpg "Frame Layout")   
2. Take the middle 2' piece and mount both of the 7-Hole Tee Joining Plates in the center of the extrusion. Then mount the corner brackets on the ends. Place all the screws into the slots of the brackets and put the T-Nut on each screw loosely before sliding it into place. This makes the assembly process much simpler. **The plate takes the screws with the larger heads and flat edges.**  
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/middleLarge.jpg "Assembling Middle Section")  

    **I didn't at this point but you can also add the rest of the screws in the T-Plate*

3. Once done, slide it into the 3' pieces slots slightly off-center. 
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/slideMiddleLarge.jpg "Slide in Middle Section")   
4. Grab the 2' piece of extrusion closest to the middle bar and mount the corner brackets. Before sliding into place, place two of the T-Nuts into the top slot for later use. Repeat for the last 2' piece but without adding the 2 T-Nuts.  
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/finishBottomLarge.jpg "Finish Bottom Section")   
5. Once everything is put into place, tighten all the corner brackets. Now straighten all the T-Nuts on the middle bracket so the 6' pole can drop in easily. Then place the 6' pole. Make sure to center the plates in the middle of the extrusion before tightening. Tighten the bottom 4 screws on each side before tightening the plates to the 6' pole.  
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/tightenAndPole.jpg "Add Pole")   

    **Now that the basic frame is done, you will realize that the 6' pole is quite wobbly and putting a lot of stress on the beam. This is where the wire comes into play.*  

6. Take one of the 9" cables and two ferrules and stops. On one end of the wire, take a ferrule and place the cable through one of the gaps and then back thought the other gap creating a loop. Shrink the loop then crimp the ferrule. Then add the stopper on the scrap of wire left to prevent fraying. Crimp the stop as well.  
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/ferrule.jpg "Making Wire Loops")   

    **I didn't have a crimping tool so I just used the yellow handled combination pliers and crimped with the wire cutting part.*  

7. Repeat step 6 for the other 3 ends of the cable.  
8. Back on the frame, move the two T-Nuts placed earlier to the ends of the beam. Take the eye bolts and move the nut up on the bolt and screw them into the T-Nut in the frame. On the other end, place a T-Nut into each of the 3' pieces equidistant from the center pole as the other side. Then add the bolts to these T-Nuts as well. Then tighten all the nuts on the eye bolts to the extrusion.  
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/eyeBolts.jpg "Adding Eye Bolts")   

    **I added the T-Nut to the bolt before I slid it into the slot as seen in the first image. It's not necessary, but it cuts out a step.*

9. Following the same process as above, take the last two eye bolts and place them roughly 2/3rd up the center pole in the slot where the plates mounted. **Likely will require a readjustment later.**  
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/eyeBolts2.jpg "Adding Eye Bolts on Pole")   
10. Take one of your fastener (whether it be a carabiner or s-hook) and attach it to one of the eye bolts and the other end of the fastener with the loop in the cable. Then feed the other end of the cable through the center eye bolt and back down to the eye bolt parallel to its anchor. Loosen both ends of your turnbuckle all the way so it is full extended and connect the hanging wire to the turnbuckle, then the turnbuckle to the eye bolt. Don't tighten turnbuckle yet. If the turnbuckle cannot reach the eye bolt or there is too much slack, pull the wire out of the middle and adjust accordingly then try again.

    *The Home Depot I went to was stripped of the double hook turnbuckles so I had to get the one with one hook and got an extra S-hook to attach the wire, but otherwise, the wire connects directly to the turnbuckle.*
 
11. Repeat step 10 for other side of post. Once completed, tighten the turnbuckle on each side. Do a little at a time on both sides to make sure the vertical pole isn't being pulled a certain direction. Tighten to the point where the corners start to bow upward and then loosen until they return back flush to the floor. Over-tightening can cause rocking and potentially bend or break the extrusion.  

The first part is complete and should be quite stable. This piece will hold the claw that will drop the ball. Now, it is time to build the stand to hold the camera.

1. Take all three 1' pieces, the remaining 3' piece, and the remaining 4 corner brackets and lay them out like below.   
![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/smallStart.jpg "Starting Layout Small Frame")  
2. Just like before, take the middle piece and mount the two 5 hole plates on the center of the piece and mount the brackets on the ends with the bolts and T-Nuts in place to slide into the 1' rails.

![alt text](https://github.com/mjdonovan410/TinyTitan-PhysicsExperiment/raw/master/Construction_Info/Images/baseSmall.jpg "Base of Small Frame")   
3. Slide the middle bar into the rails and tighten it roughly in the middle of the two pieces of 1' extrusion. Then drop the 3' pole in between the plates. Then tighten everything.

Everything should be properly assembled at this point and ready for the Pis, the claw, and the camera.

#### Claw Assembly
This part of the Assembly is where students can get involved. We have developed a claw to work for this experiment but any claw developed could work. It would be interesting to make it a project and then choose the best one.

As for this experiment, we do have a claw thanks to the work of Dr. Lonnie Love and Josh Reed. The files needed are in the folder named `Claw Parts`.
